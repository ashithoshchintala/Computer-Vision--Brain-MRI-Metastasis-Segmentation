Explain the architectures (Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net) and how they apply to metastasis segmentation.
Discuss how each model handles segmentation and why you selected these models.
Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the repository and running the code.
Challenges

Discuss challenges such as the small size of metastases or their unclear boundaries, and how you addressed these challenges (e.g., with CLAHE or attention mechanisms).


 Clinical Relevance
Add a discussion on the clinical implications of accurate brain metastasis segmentation, such as improving treatment outcomes or aiding in early diagnosis.
